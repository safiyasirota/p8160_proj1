	abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common form of pediatric cancer which is categorized into three L1, L2, and L3 and could be detected through screening of blood and bone marrow smears by pathologists. Due to being time-consuming and tediousness of the procedure, a computer-based system is acquired for convenient detection of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Microscopic images are acquired from blood and bone marrow smears of patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and normal cases. After applying image preprocessing, cells nuclei are segmented by k-means algorithm. Then geometric and statistical features are extracted from nuclei and finally these cells are classified to cancerous and noncancerous cells by means of support vector machine classifier with 10-fold cross validation. These cells are also classified into their sub-types by multi-Support vector machine classifier. Classifier is evaluated by these parameters: Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy which values for cancerous and noncancerous cells 98\%, 95\%, and 97\%, respectively. These parameters are also used for evaluation of cell sub-types which values in mean 84.3\%, 97.3\%, and 95.6\%, respectively. The results show that proposed algorithm could achieve an acceptable performance for the diagnosis of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and its sub-types and can be used as an assistant diagnostic tool for pathologists.},

	abstract = {Multiple risk factors contribute to suicides; however, patterns of co-occurrence among these factors have not been fully identified.To assess patterns of known suicide-related risk factors, classify suicide decedents by these patterns, track class proportions during a 6-year period, and characterize decedents across the classes to help focus prevention strategies.Latent class analysis was conducted using 2003-2008 data from the National Violent Death Reporting System. The population included 28 703 suicide decedents from 12 US states.The known risk factors included having the following: mental health conditions; a sad or depressed mood; substance abuse problems; medical problems; recent crises; financial, job, and legal problems; intimate partner and other relationship problems; and perpetrated interpersonal violence.Nine distinct patterns of risk factors emerged. Of these classes, 1 only endorsed mental health–related factors and 1 only endorsed alcohol- and substance abuse–related factors; however, 7 classes of decedents had distinct patterns of factors that spanned multiple domains. For example, 5 of these classes had mental health factors with other risks (eg, substance abuse, financial problems, relationship problems, a recent crisis, and medical problems). Two classes had recent crises with relationship problems; one of these classes also had high probabilities for criminal problems and interpersonal violence. Class proportions differed during the 6 years. Differences across classes by demographic and event characteristics were also found.Most suicide decedents could be classified by patterns of risk factors. Furthermore, most classes revealed a need for more connected services across medical, mental health/substance abuse, and court/social service systems. Reducing fragmentation across these agencies and recruiting family, friend, and community support for individuals experiencing mental health problems and/or other stress might significantly reduce suicides.},
